# PRE-OWNED-CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION

## Introduction
The pre-owned market has been outpacing the new car market, and the industry is expected to clock a healthy growth rate of 15 per cent in FY22.

The prospects continue to be bright on the longer horizon, with a 12-14 per cent CAGR expected over the next few years, taking the size of the market to more than 7 million vehicles by FY26, from 3.8 million units in FY21..

## Objective of the project.

	This dataset contains information about used cars.

	This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction (Selling Price).

## Steps for creating a machine learning model.

1. Collecting Data:
It is of the utmost importance to collect reliable data so that your machine learning model can find the correct patterns. The quality of the data that you feed to the machine will determine how accurate your model is. If you have incorrect or outdated data, you will have wrong outcomes or predictions which are not relevant.

2. Preparing the Data:

	Putting together all the data you have and randomizing it. This helps make sure that data is evenly distributed, and the ordering does not affect the learning process.

	Cleaning the data to remove unwanted data, missing values, rows, and columns, duplicate values, data type conversion, etc. You might even have to restructure the dataset and change the rows and columns or index of rows and columns.

	Visualize the data to understand how it is structured and understand the relationship between various variables and classes present.

	Splitting the cleaned data into two sets - a training set and a testing set. The training set is the set your model learns from. A testing set is used to check the accuracy of your model after training.

3. Choosing a Model: 

A machine learning model determines the output you get after running a machine learning algorithm on the collected data. It is important to choose a model which is relevant to the task at hand.

4. Training the Model:

Training is the most important step in machine learning. In training, you pass the prepared data to your machine learning model to find patterns and make predictions. It results in the model learning from the data so that it can accomplish the task set. Over time, with training, the model gets better at predicting.

5. Evaluating the Model:

After training your model, you have to check to see how it’s performing. This is done by testing the performance of the model on previously unseen data.

Evaluating the Regression Model :-


o	Mean Squared Error (MSE)

o	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

o	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

o	R Square (R2)
